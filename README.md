# Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks are versatile documents that combine computer code with rich text elements such as comments, links, and descriptions of analyses and results. They are widely used in various online platforms, including Project Jupyter, Kaggle, and Google Colaboratory (Colab).

## What are Jupyter Notebooks?

Jupyter notebooks serve as executable documents where you can run code to perform data analysis tasks. They can be employed for a range of activities, from data cleaning and transformation to statistical modeling and visualization. The best part is that Jupyter notebooks are compatible with R, making them a suitable alternative to R Markdown. Furthermore, sharing Jupyter notebooks with team members and stakeholders is effortless, similar to R Markdown documents.

### Jupyter Notebooks in Kaggle

If you are working on Kaggle, you have two types of notebooks at your disposal: Jupyter notebooks and scripts (including R Markdown scripts).

### Jupyter Notebooks in Google Colab

Google Colab is a product by Google Research that offers a hosted Jupyter notebook service. The best part is that it requires no setup, making it extremely convenient to use.
